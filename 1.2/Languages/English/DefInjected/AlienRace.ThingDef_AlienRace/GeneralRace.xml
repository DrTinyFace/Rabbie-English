  <Rabbie.description>The Rabbie are a unique race that possess rabbit genes and are naturally proficient in war and construction. Unlike many races, they use their advanced technology to build their cities on moons where Planetarium can be found in large quantities. \n\nThrough various means, some Rabbies end up stranded on the rimworlds, completely separated from the rest of their kind.</Rabbie.description>
