  <RB_Scenario.description>Some lunar colonies grew so large that they could not accommodate the drastic growth rate of the rabbies. Some of these colonies chose to launch huge migratory ships to satellites and other planets. \nThis worked for a while, but soon the Rabbitish Empire realized that planets were getting too far apart to send large ships and began sending small groups of Rabbies to distant planets with no one but each other. \n\n Crash landing on the foreign planet, you awaken to find yourself light years away from your old home with only a handful of planetarium and some basic survival supplies. There are signs of other Rabbies having lived on this planet, though they seem to worship some strange empress as a goddess, and no doubt a malevolent one at that. You decide to make a home of this strange new planet, at least until you can escape it.</RB_Scenario.description>
